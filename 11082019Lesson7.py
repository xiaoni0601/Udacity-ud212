# ------subpalindrome--------
# User Instructions
#
# Write a function, longest_subpalindrome_slice(text) that takes 
# a string as input and returns the i and j indices that 
# correspond to the beginning and end indices of the longest 
# palindrome in the string. 
#
# Grading Notes:
# 
# You will only be marked correct if your function runs 
# efficiently enough. We will be measuring efficency by counting
# the number of times you access each string. That count must be
# below a certain threshold to be marked correct.
#
# Please do not use regular expressions to solve this quiz!
